    <h2>Study Choice Journey</h2>
    <strong>Date: September 9, 2025</strong>
    <p>Choosing my study program was simple because I always had intrest in ICT an it what felt right.
      After completing the programme I see myself in a role where I can be more Creative and a Team player.
      In four years I hoped to have learned real world experiences and grown more confidence in my abilities an
      aspirations. </p>

    <h2>Personal SWOT Analysis</h2>
    <strong>Date: September 9, 2025</strong>
    <p> My strengths are that I am self motivated, Determined, patient an not given
      up when things start to get hard.
      One of my weaknesses is that i may overthink stuff. But I am learning an trusting myself more.
      I see opportunities to learn new things to grow and reach my goals. This will help me become more confident and
      see things Im good at.
      Some threats I see are having too much work. It can be hard to balance that and other things. But i will not be
      afraid to ask for help if it is needed instead of struggling</p>

    <p> I first start learning to code in high school the really small basics. Learning to code has been a fun,I
      really like telling the computer what to do an it does it. Iâ€™ve
      built some small projects and it changed the way I look at computers. </p>
