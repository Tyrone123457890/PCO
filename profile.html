  <h1>Who Am I?</h1>

  <p>My name is Tyrone Washington, and I am currently 18 years old. I lived on a beautiful island called St. Maarten, a place rich in cultural diversity and tourism. I live with both of my parents, who have always been a strong source of support and encouragement. During my time in secondary school, I focused on the Business profile. I studied subjects such as Principles of Business and some Economics.</p>
<br>
  <p>Some hobbies I have are playing sports and listening to music. <em>Star Wars</em> is a movie I can watch over and over again without getting tired—I'm a fan of its storytelling.</p>

  <h1>Characteristics of Myself</h1>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Patience:</strong> I understand that growth takes time.</li>
    <li><strong>Determination:</strong> I don’t give up easily and always try to find solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Positive:</strong> I stay in a good mood even when things get hard.</li>
  </ul>
