  <h1>My Motivation for Choosing HBO-ICT At HZ</h1>
  <p>The HBO-ICT programme at HZ gives me real world experience that fits my passion for technology and problem solving.
    We’ll be working on real world projects and collaborating with actual companies, which will help us prepare for
    future jobs.
    It also lets me explore different areas in ICT.</p>

  <p>The programme supports creativity. I want to work in a field where I can keep learning, grow through
    new challenges, and help create useful solutions. HBO-ICT gives me the right tools and environment to achieve that.
    After completing the programme I see myself in a role where I can be more Creative and a Team player. In four years
    I hoped to have learned real world experiences and grown more confidence in my abilities an aspirations.
